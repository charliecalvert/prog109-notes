I received a Master of Education from the University of Washington in 2005.</span><br /><br /><span>I attended Bellevue College as a student in the late 1990s to earn a certificate in Web Authoring. After I graduated from BC I contracted with multiple places including Microsoft, GoMobile, Limelight Media, The Creative Group, William Meacham Insurance, and The Museum of Radio and Electricity. My work has varied between client-side web development and video editing.&nbsp;<strong>I am currently the E-Learning Specialist with the Healthcare Informatics BAS Program at Bellevue College.</strong>&nbsp;This gives me a lot of opportunity to use HTML and Javascript on a daily basis.</span><br /><br /><span>I&rsquo;ve been an instructor since 2000. The subjects that I have taught vary quite a bit between web development, animation, and history of film for example.</span><br /><br /><span>On the personal side of things I enjoy getting outside hiking and running around.&nbsp; I try to&nbsp; participate in several 5k &amp; 10ks a year. I bike and ski if the weather is not too rainy.&nbsp; I also have a kid who turned 18 this year and rides a unicycle and skateboards a lot.</span><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p>
