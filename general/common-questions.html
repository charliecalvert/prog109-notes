                        <p>An integrated development environment (IDE) is an essential tool for most <em>web page developers</em>. Though I usually use WebStorm and Geany, in this class we will probably use Visual Studio Code.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>NOTE</b>: <em>I tend to make recommendations rather than force decisions on you. Though I don't recommend it, you may choose to spend the entire quarter working in just notepad++ or another tool such as Sublime Text, Aptana, Webstorm, Dreamweaver, Visual Studio Code,
                            Brackets, or any number of programs out there.</em></p>
                        <p><em>If you are an experienced developer this will be an easy course for you. However, my experience is that most students in this course don't have a deep background writing code and find the material challenging. It is simplest for those students just to use the same tools I use. That way they can more easily immitate what I'm doing, and it is usually much easier for me to provide help. In some cases, if a student chooses a tool I don't know, then I will not be able to help them at all due to time constraints.</em></p>

                        <p>For the midterm or final contact me immediately in the case of an emergancy to arrange alternative submission dates. I generally accept late submissions for other assignments, particularly if they are a bit tricky. If an assignment is turned in one to three days late it will cost you a few points and be no big deal, at least from my perspective. But assignments that are weeks late are hard for me to grade because I've forgotten what I was looking for on the assignment and how other students performed. In those cases, expect serious grade penalities.</p>

                    <td>I hope to be available for 1/2 hour after class on Mondays but this depends on factors beyond my control. Contact me to schedule another time if necessary. The best technique is to submit questions in the discussion area. In some cases we can meet online Thursday mornings via Google Hangouts. We will discuss this further in class. With very rare exceptions, never send technical questions to my personal or Canvas email. Use those tools only for discussing personal matters that are non technical. For instance, if you have a health issue or a crisis of some kind then you can use email to contact me. But nearly all technical questions go to either the discussion area or Google Hangouts.

For further information you will want to consult a fellow student or an online resource. In general, my policy is to allow each student to miss one class without comment. If you miss multiple classes then my sympathy for any potential hardships you may encounter might be affected. I am not heartless, but I'm prejudice in favor of students who attend class regularly.

                        other students, floating around the Internet.
