            <p><strong>1. Which IDE should I use to create my web pages?</strong></p>
        </td>

        <td valign="top">
            <p>An IDE usually stands for integrated development environment. For this class it is a fancy way to say <strong>web page creator</strong>. In this course we will start off with&nbsp;<strong>notepad</strong> -- a bare bones editor available with MS Windows. After that -- even though you can design whole websites with nothing but a simple editor like notepad -- we&nbsp;will often work with <strong>notepad++</strong> (because of all its user-friendly features). I will also use Brackets. </p>
            <p>You may choose to spend the entire quarter working in just notepad or notepad++. You may also use another environment such as Sublime Text, Aptana, Webstorm, Dreamweaver, Visual Studio, Brackets, or any number of programs out there. </p>
            <p>The most important thing is to <em>not</em> let it get in your way. I've actually had students not complete their assignments because they didn't know which application to use to create their web sites. Generally notepad++ or Brackets will work fine. <span><br /><br /></span></p>

        <td valign="top">
            <p>Brackets is available for free. Adobe Dreamweaver is available at a discount to enrolled students. Please consult the adobe.com website for further information about ordering their product. A limited edition of Visual Studio is available for enrolled BC students through the DreamSpark WebStore.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another IDE that gets rave reviews is WebStorm (available at <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">www.jetbrains.com</a>). An academic license is available for $29 at this time.&nbsp;</p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top">There may be tutors to help with programming available in the Academic Success Center (located in Bldg D204). This varies from quarter to quarter. If you are looking for tutoring assistance, the best place to start is by calling them at 425-564-2200 or check the website at <a href="http://bellevuecollege.edu/asc/tutoring">http://bellevuecollege.edu/asc/tutoring</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top">Certainly some classes will cover more crucial material than others, but each day will have new, hopefully interesting, information. If you are unable to attend class then email me and I can supply a couple of bullet points as to what we went over. For further information you will want to consult a fellow student, the book. and the syllabus.&nbsp;</td>

        <td><strong>9. I see that there are multiple Programming 109 classes being offered. May I sit on the other one?</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">Unfortunately Washington State and Bellevue College do not allow people to sit in on classes they are not enrolled in. Sitting in a different section of 109 is technically a different class. Also, space is often limited in the classes at this time. Therefore if you need extra class time please try to form a study group with other students.&nbsp;</td>

        <td><strong>10. May I use a video camera, iPhone, or other device to record your lectures?</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">I don't allow recording of video recording unless it is authorized by DRC (Disability Resource Center). Recording audio may be OK with me, but please check with me first. This is for several reasons including copyright of educational content (both my content and BC's), the privacy of other students in the class, and my privacy.&nbsp; If you have permission of DRC then it is OK as long as you also agree not to post the recorded audio or video content to internet sites (public or private), or make any content available to anyone else in any format. Please understand that I want to be protective of my own image, and the images/audio of other students, floating around the Internet.</td>
