            <h1>Looping over Complex Types</h1>

            <p>The simple types are <b>number</b>, <b>string</b>, <b>boolean</b>, <b>null</b>, and <b>undefined</b>. These types are essential to JavaScript programming and you must understand them.</p>
            
            <p>There are two important complex types that you must know. The good news is that they are not really that complex, they are not really that hard to understand. The types are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Arrays</li>
                <li>Objects</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Both these types are commonly used in loops, so we will cover that subject at the same time.</p>

        <section id="get-started">
            <h2>Get Started</h2>
            
            <p>In your <b>javascript-tests</b> directory create a file called <b>looping-over-complex-types.js</b>. We will do some work during class in that file. At the end of the class, be sure to push the file.</p>

        <section id="arrays">
            <h2>Arrays</h2>

            <p>Here is how to declare an array:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const myArray = [];
            </pre>

            <p>We can also pre-populate our array with content:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10];
            </pre>

            <p>Here is how to access a memeber of this array using zero based indexers</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10];
    console.log(numbers[1]);
    console.log(numbers[0]);
    console.log(numbers[numbers.length - 1]);
            </pre>

            <p>Here is how to dynamically add an item to an array:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10];
    numbers.push(12);
    console.log(numbers);
    numbers.pop(); // Remove the last item
    console.log(numbers);
            </pre>

            <p>As you will see later, you can put numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects in inside an array. For instance:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const items = [1, 'two', [3, 4], false, null];
            </pre>            

        </section>

        <section id="loop-array">
            <h2>Loop over Arrays</h2>

            <p>Here is how to loop over an array:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const items = [1, 'two', [3, 4], false, null];
    for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        console.log(items[i]);
    }                    
            </pre>

            <p>Here is a simpler way to loop over an array:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10];
    for (let number of numbers) {
        console.log(numbers);
    }                    
            </pre>

            <p>Here are JavaScript methods for converting a string to an array and vice-versa:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    function arrayToString(array) {
        console.log(array.join(', '));
    }

    function stringToArray(input) {
        console.log(input.split(','));
    }


    arrayToString(["bundle.js", "*.js.map", ".c9"]);

    stringToArray("bundle.js, *.js.map, .c9");
            </pre>
        </section>
        
        <section id="objects">
            <h2>Objects</h2>

            <p>Objects contain properties and functions. For now, we will only add properties to our objects.</p>

            <p>Here is how to declare an object:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const myObject = {};
            </pre>

            <p>Here is how to declare an object with two properties:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const myObject = {
        five: 5,
        six: 'six'
    };
            </pre>

            <p>Here is how to access a member of this object</p>
        
            <pre class="code scr">
    const myObject = {
        five: 5,
        six: 'six'
    };            

    console.log(myObject.five);
    console.log(myObject.six);
            </pre>

            <p>Here is how to dynamically add an item to an object:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
    const myObject = {
        five: 5,
        six: 'six'
    };            

    myObject.newItem = 'This is a new item in my object.'
    console.log(myObject.five);
    console.log(myObject.six);
    console.log(myObject.newItem);
            </pre>
        </section>

            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push the work we did in class today. When you submit the assignment, state the name of your repo and the name of the file where we did our work. Create a file called <b>javascript-tests/looping-over-complex-types.html</b>. Give it a h1 element and your byline. Link in <b>looping-over-complex-types.js</b> and link to it from your home page. Provide a link to your home page on the GitHub Pages live site.</p>

        <section id="global-objects">
            <h2>Global Objects</h2>

            <p>There are no instructions in this section, it is just a rather lengthy discussion of an important topic.</p>

            <p>There are differences between the JavaScript in Node and JavaScript in a browser. Even though Node is built with the same V8 Engine used to create the JavaScript in a browser, there are still differences.</p>

            <p>Step back and think for a second. When we are working at the command line there usually are no windows. That is the big difference between a GUI environment and a command-line environment: The GUI has windows and the command line does not. (I'm talking about windows in an application, not about the Microsoft product called Windows.)</p>

            <p>As a result, there is no&nbsp;<strong>window</strong> object at the command prompt and Node does not have a global object called <b>window.</b>. This makes sense because usually there can be no buttons, no input controls, etc at the command prompt.</p>

            <p>Once we start using&nbsp;<strong>window.onload</strong> or <strong>document.getElementId</strong> then we are committed to using a browser.</p>
            
            <p>There are ways to divide programs up so we can put GUI elements in one JavaScript file and non-GUI code in another file. This would allow us to test some of our code at the command line. For now, however, that is beyond the scope of this course.</p>

            <p>Node has an object called <strong>global</strong> that plays the same role as the <strong>window</strong> object in a browser, but with all the GUI related code stripped from it:</p>
