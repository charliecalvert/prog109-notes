            <h2>Simple Functions</h2>

            <p>Our goal is to learn about JavaScript functions and to review getting simple input from the user. Use the
                <b>ListButton</b> and <b>Function Basics</b> assignments to help you with portions of this assignment.
            </p>

            </ul>

        </section>
        <section id="get-started">
            <h2>Get Started</h2>

            <p>Inside the <b>javascripts-tests</b> directory create <b>function-input.html</b> and
                <b>function-input.js</b>. Initialize the HTML file as we always do. Add a <b>script</b> statement to the
                <b>head</b> element of the HTML file. Use the script element to link in the JavaScript file. Create a
                link from your home page to <b>function-input.html</b>.</p>

            <p>When declaring methods, use ES6 (fat arrow) syntax throughout.</p>

        <section id="key-steps">
            <h2>The Key Steps</h2>

            <p>We want to create a program that looks, at minimum, like this</p>

            <p><img class="normal-image"
                    src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/function-input-ui.png"
                    alt="Function input ui"></p>

            <p>Create a <b>window.onload = () => {}</b> block as we have in previous programs. Just below it, create
                four functions as specified in this table:</p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Function Name</th>
                        <th>Parmeters</th>
                        <th>Formula</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>feetToInches</td>
                        <td>feet</td>
                        <td>feet * numberOfInchesInAFoot</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>milesToFeet</td>
                        <td>miles</td>
                        <td>miles * numberOfFeetInAMile</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>areaOfTriangle</td>
                        <td>base, height</td>
                        <td>area = base times height divided by two</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>areaOfCircle</td>
                        <td>radius</td>
                        <td>area = Math.PI * radius squared</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>For instance, feet to inches would look like this:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll"><code>
const feetToInches = (feet) => {
    return feet * 12;
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>To get the value of PI, use the constant <b>Math.PI</b>. For instance, seven + PI is <b>7 + Math.PI</b>.
                Note that calculating the area of a triangle requires two parameters. Here is how we pass to parameters
                to a function using fat arrow syntax:</p>

            <pre class="class scroll">
const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
}
            </pre>

            I'm sure you can imagine how this looks when we use function syntax rather than fat arrow syntax:

            <pre class="code scroll">
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
            </pre>

            <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>Trying to understand <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">why
                        arrow functions</a> were added to the language is beyond the scrope of this course. My goal is
                    simply to help you both recognize and use the arrow function syntax. You need this skill because
                    arrow functions are now very common, and you will encounter them when searching for help and
                    examples on the web.</i></p>

        <section id="show-results">
            <h2>Show Results in Html</h2>
            <p>In <b>function-input.html</b> create an H1 element with the content <b>Function Input</b>.</p>
            <p>Add four paragraph elements that contain an span with an id:</p>
            <pre class="code scroll">
&lt;span id="some-id"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>Add an appropriate caption to each paragraph. Give the spans the following IDs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>feetToInchesDisplay</li>
                <li>milesToFeetDisplay</li>
                <li>areaOfTriangleDisplay</li>
                <li>areaOfCircleDisplay</li>
            </ul>

            For instance, write something like what follows:

            <pre class="code"><code>
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Feet to Inches&lt;/b&gt;: 
  &lt;span 
    id="feetToInchesDisplay"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
            </code></pre>

            <p>If you want, the paragraph and span can be all on one line.</p>

            <h2>Buttons and Inputs</h2>

            <p>We are now going to put four buttons next to four inputs. Create a div for each button and input pair.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>div
                    <ul>
                        <li>button</li>
                        <li>input</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Set the IDs of the buttons to: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>feetToInchesAction</li>
                <li>milesToFeetAction</li>
                <li>areaOfTriangleAction</li>
                <li>areaOfCircleAction</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Set IDs of Input controls to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>feetToInchesInput</li>
                <li>milesToFeetInput</li>
                <li>areaOfTriangleInput</li>
                <li>areaOfCircleInput</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Give them the appropriate content for the label of each button. For instance, the first would be <b>Feet
                    to Inches</b></p>

            <p>In <b>function-input.js</b>, inside the <b>window.onload</b> method, respond to clicks on the button by
                calling all four functions and their methods and displaying the output in the appropriate paragraph
                element.</p>

            <p>Recall that the <a href="function-basics.html">Function Basics</a> assignment contains hints on how to
                perform these tasks.</p>

            <p>In particular, remember that you will need to ask the document to use the id to get the element for the:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>buttons</li>
                <li>inputs</li>
                <li>paragraphs</li>
            </ul>

            <p id="onload">
                For instance:
            </p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
window.onload = () => {
    const feetToInchesAction = 
        document.getElementById('feetToInchesAction');

    feetToInchesAction.onclick = () => {
        const feetToInchesInput = document.getElementById('feetToInchesInput');
        const feetToInchesDisplay = document.getElementById('feetToInchesDisplay');

        feetToInchesDisplay.textContent = feetToInches(feetToInchesInput.value);
    };
};

const feetToInches = (feet) => {
    return feet * 12;
};
                    
            </pre>

            <p>Remember: you will need to match the IDs declared in your HTML to the IDs you use in your JavaScript
                calls to <b>document.getElementById</b>. This can prove to be surprisingly tricky.</p>

            <p>If I give an HTML element an ID of <b>someId</b>, and then write <b>getElementById('sameId')</b>, my code
                will not work. Little typos such as <b>someId</b> vs <b>sameId</b> are so easy to make that I suggest
                block copying your IDs from the HTML file to your JavaScript code. If you get errors or no response when
                you click a button, a good place to start your debug process is to make sure your IDs match. Using
                <b>console.log</b> or breakpoints to help you see exactly what is happening would be a likely second
                step.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Styles</h2>

            <p>Create and link in a file called <b>function-input.css</b> with this content</p>

            <pre class="code scroll"><code>
    button {
        float: left;
        width: 150px;
    }
    
    input {
        float: left;
        width: 45px;
    }
    
    div {
        clear: both;
    }
            </code></pre>

            <p>If you want, style your buttons as you did in the <b>List Button</b> assignment. Add any other custom
                styling to the
                page that you want, but be sure all the styles you use are custom written by hand. Do not block copy
                CSS from some other project you find on the web, and do not use CSS properties that we have not
                discussed in class. (Okay, I might take a maximum one or two other properties, but only if you explain
                how they work in the paragraph you added at top of the HTML page.) In other words, I don't want you
                pasting in CSS that you don't completely understand, and I want you to stick exclusively, or almost
                exclusively, to the CSS properties we have discussed in class.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="triangle">

            <h2>Triangle Hints</h2>
            <p>The triangle is tricky because it requires two parameters rather than just one. Think of our add function
                that we have discussed in class several times:</p>
            <pre class="code scroll">
function add(a, b) {
   return a + b;
}
            </pre>
            <p>This function takes two parameters: <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.</p>
            <p>I tell you that you can get the area of a triangle by:</p>
            <pre>area = base times height divided by two</pre>
            <p>Perhaps you can see that you can't calculate the area without knowing two things. The user has to enter
                in both things, and you have to retrieve both bits of user input and pass them as parameters to the
                function that calculates the triangle's area.</p>
            <p>Okay, that is enough of a hint.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="turn-it-in">

            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your repository. When you submit your assignment, tell me the folder and file names you have
                used. (The folder and file names should, of course, be as specified above. If you have, however, gone
                off the res, then let me know.) When you turn in the assignment, also include a link to your repository.
            </p>

            <p>You <b>must</b> provide a link to your page running on GitHub Pages.
                Be sure to include a clickable link to your running pages. Use the Canvas Text page to provide these
                links.
                Often after you paste in a link it becomes "hot" immediately. That is, it shows up in blue, underlined
                text. If this does not happen, put your cursor at the end of the link and press enter. That should
                "activate"
                the link.
            </p>

            <p>Hot link: <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com/</a></p>

            <p>Cold link: <a href="https://www.google.com/"></a>https://www.google.com/</p>

            <p>Note that we can just click on the hot link to use it, but the cold link requires a cut and paste
                operation.</p>
