            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>We need a way for the user to set up a menu, table of contents or index to support navigation through the:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Site</li>
                <li>Document</li>
                <li>Across the web to remote sites</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                In this assignment we will set up navigation for the document and the footer. We will tackle setting up
                the navigation for the entire site and remote sites in a separate assignment.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="nav">
            <h2>The nav Tag</h2>

            <p>Just as we put headers in a <b>header</b> element and footers in a <b>footer</b> element, we should put
                navigation elements in the HTML5 block level <b>nav</b> element. It's supported by all modern browsers and IE 9 and higher.</p>

            <p>Inside the <b>nav</b> element we put links to locations in our documents. Typically, that would be an unordered list or simply a set of anchor tags.</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>The About page for our site should be in the root of your repository. Don't put it in the <b>assignments</b> directory as the About page is a standard part of all sites, and is usually placed in the root. There may be exceptions on the web, but the majority of times it belongs in the root. It is okay to have a separate about page in the theme directory for use in your theme, but that is not the site wide About page.</p>

            <p>We often use the same HTML for various navigation elements regardless of the role they play. For instance, a navigation-bar on the top of a site, and a side-bar on the right or left of a site, are created with similar HTML. They could, for instance, both be variants of the unordered list shown above. We distinguish navigation-bars from side-bars by how we style them in our CSS.</p>

            <p>I should perhaps add that we frequently use top level navigation-bars for navigation through a site, and use side-bars for navigation through a page. But there are no hard and fast rules here.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="style-it">
            <h1>Style it</h1>
            <p>The problem we face now is that the navigation control we have created doesn't look right:</p>

            <div class="demo-bad">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/index.html">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="/about.html">About</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                We want it to look like this, with no discs and with the list items arranged horizontally rather than
                vertically:
            </p>

            <div class="demo-good">

                <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="/index.html">Home</a></li>
                        <li><a href="/about.html">About</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </nav>
            </div>

            <p>To do that, we style the <b>nav</b> tag and its unordered list:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
    nav {        
        background-color: aliceblue;
        border: 1px green solid;
        padding: 8px;
        margin: -1px 0px 0px 0px;
    }
    
    nav ul {
        list-style-type: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        
    }
    
    nav li {
        display: inline;
        padding: 8px;    
    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>The key declarations here are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>list-style-type: none; on the unordered list.</li>
                <li>display: inline; on the list items</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first declaration gets rid of the discs. The second sets the display of the list to inline. This
                means that it is no longer a block display. As a result, each list item is not shown on its on line, it
                is not shown in its own vertical block. Instead, the list items are spread out horizontally.</p>

            <p>Notice also the -1px value in the <b>nav margin</b> declaration. This is done to "collapse" the border between the header or footer and their adjacent nav sections. In a real site, we probably would not include these borders, but I have put them in this document to help you see how the header and footer fit with their nav elements. Just look at the source for this page if you have questions about exactly how this works.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="internal-links">
            <h1>Internal Links</h1>

            <p>When navigating inside a document, we use internal links. This means we link from one part of a document
                to another part. Typically we are linking from a TOC to a section of the document.</p>

            <p>We have been breaking out document up into three sections: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>header</li>
                <li>main</li>
                <li>footer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Inside the <b>main</b> element we might have multiple sections. We can put <b>ids</b> on each section:</p>

            <pre class="scroll">
                <code>
    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;section id="jazz"&gt; ... &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section id="rock"&gt; ... &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section id="classical"&gt; ... &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Now we can link to each section in our anchor tags like this:</p>

            <pre class="scroll">
                <code>
    &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#jazz"&gt;Jazz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#rock"&gt;Rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#classical"&gt;Classical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Note that there are two steps in creating the HREF for the anchor elements:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Use the hash (#) symbol to specify that this is an internal link.</li>
                <li>Type in the name of the ID of the section that you want to jump to.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now, when the user clicks on a link, they should be taken to appropriate part of the document.</p>

        <section>
            <h1 id="turn-it-in">Turn it in</h1>
            <p>Add a styled internal TOC to your main page for your theme. Include at least one internal link (the kind that begin with a hash mark). Add or modify a site wide TOC to the home page for your entire site that links to all the major documents you have created. This TOC need not be styled, in other words, it can be a simple unordered list. You can try to do something more elaborate if you want. You don't need to link to each page in a directory, just to the index page for a directory. The assumption is that each default <b>index.html</b> for a directory will link to all the pages in that directory. By <i>all the pages</i>, I mean all the HTML pages, not all the CSS or image files.</p>
            <p>Provide a link to your home page for your site and theme running on your live GitHub pages site. These URLs do not include <b>github.com</b>. Also include the URL to your repository. These URLs do contain <b>github.com</b>.</p>
            <p>Push your work.</p>
