            <p>We are going to learn more about JavaScript functions. Use the <b>ListButton</b> assignment to help you

        </section>
        <section id="get-started">
            <h2>Get Started</h2>

            <p>Inside the <b>javascripts-tests</b> directory create <b>function-basics.html</b> and <b>function-basics.js</b>.
                Add a <b>script</b> statement to the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file that links in the JavaScript
                file. </p>
            <p>Create a link from your home page to <b>function-basics.html.</b></p>

        </section>
        <section id="build-functions">
            <h2>Build Functions</h2>

            <p>In what follows, When I ask you to print something out, use console.log to print it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a function called <b>simpleFunction</b> that prints out the phrase: "functions should
                    consist of statements designed to perform a single task."</li>
                <li>Create a function called <b>functionParameters</b> that takes a single parameter and prints it out.</li>
                <li>Create a function called <b>functionReturn</b> that returns the string "Many functions return
                    values."</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At the bottom of <b>function-basics.js</b> call all three functions. Pass the following string to <b>functionParameters</b>:
                "Many functions take parameters."</p>
        </section>

        <section id="build-page">
            <h2>Show Results in Html</h2>
            <p>In <b>function-basics.html</b> create an H1 element with the content <b>Function Basics</b>.</p>
            <p>Add three empty paragraph (P) elements. Give them the following IDs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>simpleFunctionDisplay</li>
                <li>functionParametersDisplay</li>
                <li>functionReturnDisplay</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add a button with the content <b>Call Functions</b> and the ID set to <b>functionCallsAction</b></p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
&lt;button id="THE ID GOES HERE"&gt;THE CONTENT GOES HERE&lt;button&gt;
            </pre>

            <p>In <b>function-basics.js</b>, inside an <b>window.onload</b> method, respond to clicks on the button by
               creating a function that calls all three functions that you created earlier. It should display
               the output in the appropriate paragraph element.</p>

            <p>Here are some hints. First, be sure all your code is inside the <b>window.onload</b> method:</p>

            <pre class="code">
                <code>
window.onload = () => {
    // All code goes in here.
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>The <b>onload</b> function is called when an HTML file (<b>document</b>) has finished loading into the main browser <b>window</b>. It is important because our JavaScript file uses <b>document.getElementById</b> to retrieve a handle to HTML elements on the web page you created. If the HTML page (<b>document</b>) has not been loaded, it can't be queried with <b>getElementById</b>. It would be like a student in the classroom asking me a question before I had arrived: it just wouldn't work. You have to wait for me to get there, and get set up, and then you can ask me a question. The <b>onload</b> event tells you that the page is loaded and can be queried, it tells you that Charlie is in the classroom and ready to answer questions</p>

            <p>Please remember that the <b>window</b> object is only available in the browser. If we try to run code 
            that uses <b>window</b> from the command prompt it will raise an exception. It will, however, run smoothly 
            in a browser.</p>

            <p>Once we introduce <b>window</b> into a JavaScript file then we may not be able to run it 
            with Node at the command prompt. I say "may" because we could reference the <b>window</b> object inside 
            a function that does not get called, and hence the rules of scoping would ensure that no
            exception would be raised. But for now, it is simplest if you just think: "Ok, I have referenced 
            the <b>window</b> object so I should begin working in the browser rather than at the command prompt."
            </p>
            
        </section>
        <section id="modify-paragraphs">
            <h2>Modify Paragraph Elements</h2>
            <p>
                Get a handle to the elements on the page that we are going to need to access. We do this by 
                calling <b>document.getElementById</b>. We use this method to find the HTML paragraph 
                elements on our HTML page so that we can modify their content.
            </p>

            <pre class="code scroll"><code>
const simpleFunctionDisplay = document.getElementById('simpleFunctionDisplay');
const functionCallsAction = document.getElementById('functionCallsAction');
            </code></pre>

            <p>Our goal now is to make the text in our functions to appear not only in the console window, 
               but also in our HTML pages. Modify your version of the <b>simple</b> function, 
               so that it will be able to modify the HTML by accessing the <b>textContent</b> property of the paragraph element. 
               This will set the content of the P element. In other words, your goal is to display text in one of
               the empty paragraph elements on the HTML page. For example, your code might look a little, but 
               not exactly, like this:
            </p>

            <pre class="code scroll"><code>
function simple() {
    console.log('simple');
    simpleFunctionDisplay.textContent = "simple";
}
            </code></pre>

            <p><b>HINT</b>. <i>The function I'm refering to is discussed in the <a href="#build-functions">Build Functions</a> section and begins with the word <b>simple</b>, but is a bit longer.</i></p>

            <p><b>NOTE</b>: <i>We have a slight preference for <b>textContent</b> over <b>innerHTML</b> as it is faster
                    and a bit safer. But if you want to insert HTML into an element rather than plain text, then use <b>innerHTML</b>.</i></p>
                </section>
                    <section id="handle-button-click">
                        <h2>Handle Button Click</h2>
            <p>Finally, tell the button to call our function when it is clicked</p>
            <pre class="code"><code>
functionCallsAction.onclick = function() {
    simple();
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Note that we will need to modify the other functions so that, in addition to the console.log statements,
                they also set the <b>textContent</b> of
                each paragraph in <b>function-basics.html</b>.</p>

            <p> Note also that we don't call a function when we assign it to <b>onclick</b>. In other words, we write
                this: <b>onclick = simple</b> not <b>onclick = simple()</b>. The latter has side effects that you
                probably don't want in that it executes the <b>simple</b> function at the time of the assignment,
                rather than when the button is clicked.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="add-input">

            <p>Let's make the program a bit more interesting by allowing the user to enter text, and to insert the text into our list when the button is clicked.</p>
            
            <p>Add a label and an input control to our HTML file:</p>
            
            <pre class="code scroll">
&lt;label for="nameDisplay"&gt;Enter a name&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" id="nameDisplay" name="nameDisplay"&gt;
            </pre>

            <p>Notice how we connect the label to the <b>input</b> control via the <b>for</b> attribute of the label and the <b>id</b> attribute of the <b>input</b> element.</p>

            <p> We get data from the input like this:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
const data = nameDisplay.value;                
            </pre>
            </section>
            
            <section id="add-to-list-background">
            <h2>Add to List Background</h2>
    
            <p>Sometimes we have files that we use in multiple places in our code. One such a file is <b>elf-code.js</b>
               from the ListButton assignment. As you may know, here is the contents of that file:</p>
                
            <pre class="scroll code">
const elfCode = {
    appendToList: (list, value) => {
        const li = document.createElement("li");
        li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(value));
        list.appendChild(li);
    }
}
            </pre>

            <p>We also need to remember how button <b>onclick</b> events work:</p>

            <pre class="code scroll">
const someAction = document.getElementById('someAction');
someAction.onclick = function() {
    // Handle the onclick event in here.
}
            </pre>

        </section>
    
        <section id="add-to-list">
            <h2>Add to List Steps</h2>
            <p>Link your JavaScript files into <b>function-basics.html</b>.</p>
            <pre class="code scroll">
&lt;script src="./elf-code.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </pre>
                
            <p>In <b>function-basics.html</b> also add an unordered list</p>
    
            <pre class="code scroll">
&lt;ul id="listDisplay"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
            </pre>

            <p>To make this work we need several things to happen:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We need handles to three HTML elements. Get the handle by calling <b>getElementById</b>. Get handles to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The button: <b>addToListAction</b></li>
                        <li>The list element: <b>listDisplay</b></li>
                        <li>The input element: <b>nameDisplay</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Inside the <b>onclick</b> method of the <b>addToListAction</b> button:
                    <ul>                        
                        <li>Use the <b>value</b> property of the <b>nameDisplay</b> to get the input entered by the user</li>
                        <li>Use <b>elfCode.appendToList</b> to append the user input to the <b>listDisplay</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
            </ul>

            <p>For more information on input controls and the value property, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11563667/253576">this stackoverflow discussion</a>. I'm expecting you to use method 1 of those outlined in the discussion.</p>

        <section id="turn-it-in">
            <h2>Turn it in</h2>

            <p>Push your repository. When you submit your assignment, tell the me the folder and file names you have
                used. (The folder and file names should be as specified above, some students, however, turn in work
                with alternate names, which is not a good idea. The problem is only worse if they don't tell me the
                alternate names for their files that contain their work. Even if you did follow all the instructions,
                please give me the appropriate names.
            </p>

            <p>You have two buttons. Make sure they both work.</p>

            <p>When the <b>Add to List</b> button is clicked, then information typed into the input control should be added to a list.</p>
            <p>Provide the following when the <b>Call Functions</b> button is clicked. The string associated with the following functions
                should be displayed on the HTML page:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>simpleFunction</li>
                <li>functionParameters</li>
                <li>functionReturn</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Optionally provide the code for showing the text typed into an input control.</p>

            <p>Also give me a link to your running code on GitHub pages.</p>
