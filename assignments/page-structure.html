            <section id="primary">
                <h2>The Primary Sections</h2>

                <p>Use HTML5 semantic elements to create three main blocks in the <b>index.html</b> page of your theme.
                    Each of the additional pages of your theme, including the <b>About</b> page, should contain these
                    elements.</p>

                <p>This page is an example of a document with these three blocks. Each of the major blocks has its own
                    background color. (In this document, <I></I> also provide a background color for code, but that is
                    a different subject.)</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Header</td>
                        <td>Place the main title here</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Main</td>
                        <td>Put the primary content, the body of the article, here.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Footer</td>
                        <td>Put the footer, and links to home and/or about, here.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>Keep your CSS simple. Define only the rules and declarations I ask you to define. I realize that we
                    are still not creating beautiful pages, but I want us to build up our knowledge bit by bit.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="the-header">
                <h2>The Header</h2>

                <p>We create this section with the &lt;header&gt; tag.</p>

                <p>In the CSS, define the following properties for this element:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>background-color</li>
                    <li>text-align</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Define a special p tag for the teaser</p>
                <pre class="code"><code>
    header p {
        font-weight: bold;
        color: blue;
    }
                </code></pre>

                <p>Define a class called <b>byline</b> for your attribution:</p>

                <pre class="code"><code>&lt;p class="byline"&gt;by Some Student&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

                <p class="byline">by Some Student</p>

                <p>In your css rule for this class, define the following declarations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>font-style</li>
                    <li>font-family</li>
                    <li>font-size</li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section id="main">
                <h2>Main</h2>

                <p>Use the &lt;main&gt; element for this section. This is the main section of your document, the place
                    where you put most of your content.</p>

                <p>In your CSS rule for this element, include only a <b>background-color</b> declaration.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="footer">
                <h2>Footer</h2>
                <p>Use the &lt;footer&gt; tag. In this section, include a copyright (&amp;copy;) notice and a crude
                    navigation section defined as an unordered list. The elements in the list should be hyperlinks
                    leading to places like Home and About.</p>

                <p>In the CSS, define the following properties for this element:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>background-color</b></li>
                    <li><b>text-align</b></li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="other">
                <h2>Other</h2>

                <figure class="left border">
                <img  src="../images/Icon_Information.svg" alt="info">
                <figcaption>Figure 1: Info</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>We want to include a small image like the information icon to the left. Our goal is to have the text wrap around it so the image is integrated into the page. In particular, we will have at least one relatively small image <b>float</b> left or right. To achieve your goal, wrap it in a <b>figure</b> element with a <b>class</b> called <b>left</b>. Include a <b>figcaption</b> element. This involves putting together about four lines of code. Examples of the four lines are present in the links found in this outline of the code I want you to write. </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Declare a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure">figure element</a> with a <b>class</b> of right or left</li>
                        <li>Inside it put an <b>img</b> element with <b>src</b> set to something about 100px X 100px</li>
                        <li>Next comes the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption">figcaption</a></li>
                        <li>Close the <b>figure</b> element.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p><b>Hint</b>: <i>Try to find your own unique image, but if you are stuck, consider using <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Icon_Information.svg"> this SVG image</a></i></p>                    

                <p>To float left:</p>

                <pre class="code"><code>
    figure.left {
        float: left;
    }
                </code></pre>

                <p>Also use the doo-hickey in the developer tools or your phone to see that your site looks at least
                    reasonable on a mobile device.</p>

                <p>I may define a few more CSS rules that you can create for your theme documents.</p>

                <p>In this document, I added a second class to my figure element:</p>

                <pre class="code scroll">

    figure.border {
        background-color: lightslategray;
        border: black solid thin;
        padding: 5px;
    }                    
                </pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Clear Floats</h2>

                <p>You can use the <b>clear</b> property on an element to make it move below and to the left of the
                    image you have floated to the left or right. But you might not need to do that in this case.</p>

                <p>If we float an image to the left, then sometimes everything works out right because the text we want to wrap around the image completely surrounds the image. However, there are frequent times when the image sticks out beneath the text that wanted to surround it. In that case, we can hit a but where the next section or paragraph of our content also starts to wrap around our image. For instance, a footer might begin to wrap around the image. To fix this, we could use the following CSS on the footer:</p>

                <pre class="code scroll">

    footer {
        clear: both;
    }
                </pre>

                This should ensure that the footer appears beneath the image. Sometimes our CSS code might require that we put a CLASS or ID on a section, and pick out that section in our CSS like this:

                <pre class="scroll code">

    section.clear {
        clear: both
    }
                </pre>

                <p>In this case, I'm assuming that one or more of your sections have their class set to <b>clear</b>:</p>

                <pre class="code scroll">
                    
    &lt;section class="clear"&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
                </pre>

            </section>
            <section id="turn-it-in">
                <h2>Turn it in</h2>

                <p>To turn it in, just push your repository. I'll look in your <b>root</b> directory for your
                    work on your Home page (<b>index.html</b>). Optionally, you can also create a <b>theme</b> directory and 
                    put a similar <b>index.html</b> in it, but don't include the same hyperlinks (anchors)
                    you used on Home page.</p>

                <p>I'm looking for at least two HTML files and one CSS file.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>index.html</li>
                    <li>about.html</li>
                    <li>styles.css</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The HTML files should all have the three part structure outlined in this document. In the footer,
                    the two HTML files should link to one another with an anchor element embedded in an unordered list.
                    You would create the element like this with emmet:</p>

                <pre>ul>li>a</pre>

                <p>Like this:</p>
                <pre>
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
                </pre>

                <p>In the code shown above, you need to complete the href attribute and the content of the anchor tag.
                    The content will probably be either <b>Home</b> or <b>About</b>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>About Page</h2>

                <p>If you more or less duplicated on the <b>About.html</b> page what you did in the Introductory discussion, that would be good. You can use the same bio and photo as in that assignment, or you can take a different approach if you want.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Tips</h2>

                <p>Remember:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Include a DOCTYPE and HTML, HEAD, TITLE, and BODY tags in all your HTML documents</li>
                    <li>Properly indent and format your code, then validate with the HTML Validator.</li>
                    <li>Don't use inline styles, instead put styles in CSS files.</li>
                    <li>Use lowercase markup. Not &lt;P&gt;. Instead: &lt;p&gt;</li>
                    <li>Put the various sections of your document in appropriate tags such as HEADER, MAIN or FOOTER.</li>
                </ul>
