    <p>We will be building a web page during class today, learning about the HTML Validator, and learning how include a simple CSS page. When class is over, attach the work you did to this assignment and turn it in. This assignment is very loosely defined and will be graded very lightly. A key point is that you need to be in class to get the assignment.</p>

    <p>Create a new file in the root of your repository and call it <b>in-class-part-01.html</b>. Create a CSS file called <b>hello-world.css</b> Set at least the background color for your page plus whatever else we cover in class. Use the <b>link</b> element to link your CSS from file from your HTML file. Add at least an <b>h1</b> and <b>p</b> element to your html page.</p>

    <h2>More on Emmet</h2>

    <p>Type in these Emmet commands and press tab to expand them:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>p</li>
        <li>h2</li>
        <li>ul</li>
        <li>ul>li</li>
        <li>ul>li*5</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Press <b>CTRL+SPACE</b> to see Emmet options if they do not pop up automatically.</p>

    <p>Select <b>SHIFT-CTRL-P</b> to bring up a list of all commands. Try searching for <b>Format Document</b> and then press <b>ENTER</b>. The abbreviation for the format command is CTRL-SHIFT-I.</p>

    <p><b>TIP:</b> <i>Use <b>CTRL-SHIFT-E</b> to switch between the editor and the explorer.</i></p>
    
    <h2>Turn it in</h2>

    <p>Use Git to <b>push</b> the HTML page we created together in class today. There is no specific content that I am expecting to see, but I'm expecting to see at least some of code we worked on together.</p>

    <p>When you submit the assignment in Canvas paste in the URL of your repository and repository website. Also type the name of your HTML file. It should be the same as the name listed near the beginning of this assignment.</p>
