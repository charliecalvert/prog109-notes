    <p>We will be building a web page during class today, learn about the HTML Validator, and include a simple CSS page. When class is over, attach the work you did to this assignment and turn it in. This assignment is very loosely defined and will be graded very lightly. A key point is that you need to be in class to get the assignment.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/">HTML Validator</a>.</p>
